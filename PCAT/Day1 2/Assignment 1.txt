Assignment 1: Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for
 a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's
 even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.

1. Start

2. Prompt the user to enter a number
3. Read the input number and store it in a variable, let's call it 'num'

4. Check if the number is even or odd using a conditional statement:
   IF num MOD 2 equals 0 THEN
      // The number is even
      square = num * num
      Output "The square of", num, "is", square
   ELSE
      // The number is odd
      cube = num * num * num
      Output "The cube of", num, "is", cube
   END IF
5. End
